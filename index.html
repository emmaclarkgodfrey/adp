<h2 id="whatis" class="helloo">What is APD?</a></h2>
<br>
<p class="whatisadp">
    People with auditory processing disorder (APD) have a hard time hearing small sound differences in words. Someone says, "Please raise your hand," and you hear something like "Please haze your plan." You tell your child, "Look at the cows over there," and they may hear, "Look at the clown on the chair."
    <br> <br>
    APD, also known as central auditory processing disorder, isn't hearing loss or a learning disorder. It means your brain doesn't "hear" sounds in the usual way. It's not a problem with understanding meaning.
    <br> <br>    
    People of all ages can have APD. It often starts in childhood, but some people develop it later. Between 2% and 7% of kids have it, and boys are more likely to have it than girls. The disorder can lead to learning delays, so kids who have it may need a little extra help in school.
    <br> <br>    
    APD may be linked to other things that cause similar symptoms. In fact, it may be part of the reason some people have dyslexia. And some experts think children are sometimes diagnosed with ADHD when they actually have APD.

<div class="not">
    <h2 id="whatisnot">What is APD not?</a></h2>
    <br>
<p class="whatisadpnot">
    APD is often misunderstood because many of its symptoms are similar to those found in other disorders. Also, APD symptoms can be hidden by other problems, like speech-language delays, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression. Auditory memory deficits, auditory attention problems, and sound sensitivity are not symptoms of APD, but also may involve trouble with using sound information correctly. Seeing an audiologist, and other related specialists, can help parents understand these conditions.

    <h3> COVID-19 and Auditory Processing</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="howdoesCOVID">
        As the world moves into an extended phase where masks and face coverings become routine, it is vital to consider those who have auditory processing difficulties as well as children and adults with dyslexia, autism and other labels where auditory processing challenges are common.
        <br> <br>
Face coverings and masks negatively affect many people’s processing abilities
Let us look at some of the elements of auditory processing that will be affected. Auditory processing is the ability to listen, process and respond to auditory information. Humans are usually able to hear within a range of about 20Hz – 20,000Hz, 20Hz being the lowest sound we can perceive with our ears.
<br> <br>
        When the face is covered with a mask, not only visual information is lost. Masks also mask auditory information. Higher frequencies of sound may be lost or reduced, and lower frequencies are increased. This is because the higher frequencies have less intensity and fade more rapidly than lower frequencies. High frequency sounds in speech include ‘s’, ‘th’ and ‘f’ and are around 5-6,000Hz whereas vowel sounds are lower frequency, around 250-500Hz. People with auditory processing problems may already have challenges with differentiating speech sounds that will be made considerably worse by someone speaking to them wearing a mask.
        <br> <br>   
    </p>

    <h3>Masks are called masks because they mask! </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="howdoesCOVID">
        The wearing of a face covering, or mask will reduce the perception of higher speech frequencies whilst allowing low frequencies through the mask. This is known as auditory closure and is a common problem for people with auditory processing difficulties. If you put your hand over your mouth and speak, it sounds much more muffled! Being able to hear the difference between ‘fish’, ‘this’ or ‘fist’ will be more difficult, and you would need to understand the word in the context of the whole sentence. This is something many with auditory processing difficulties must do every day anyway.
        <br> <br>
        A further problem is that many people with auditory processing difficulties use lip reading as a tool to support their listening ability. This is not possible when someone is wearing a mask so makes processing even more difficult.
        <br> <br>
        When someone speaking to you is not only wearing a mask but also a plastic face shield, the auditory impacts are even more severe. Their voice will hit the shield and be directed backwards meaning that if you are in front of them, you are relying on reflected sound to be able to process what is being said. Many people with auditory processing difficulties find it difficult to locate and attend to sounds in space. If the voice is coming from an “unknown” direction, having been reflected from walls or other surfaces, it can be difficult to process whilst deleting out any other sounds in the environment. This is known as Auditory Figure-Ground and is the most common problem for anyone with auditory processing challenges.
        <br> <br>
        Auditory information is usually added to other non-verbal information to help us understand the emotional content of communication. Our faces express numerous emotions that are lost when someone is wearing a mask. This is a serious consideration for anyone, as it is easy to misinterpret what is being said when we do not have the subtle facial information to tell whether someone is happy, sad, or angry. It is easy to see how, in the pictures above, we may not know at all the emotion that someone is feeling.

    <h2 id="whatcan">How to Help</a></h2>
    <br>
<p class="whatcanschools">
    Moving forward in this strange new world, it is important for us all to be aware that for someone with auditory processing problems, they will find it even more challenging than normal to process information in a timely manner. There are certain things that can be done to help:
    <br> <br>
    <ol> 
    <li class="help">Be aware that people with auditory processing and other developmental and learning challenges may take even longer than usual to process information.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Allow people more time to process what is being said.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Check understanding – This does not mean simply saying “Do you understand?” but asking them to paraphrase what has been said if it is important information or instructions.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Remove masks, coverings, and visors where it is safe to do so before speaking.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Remember that masks reduce the auditory as well as visual information that is so basic in everyday communication.
    </li>
</ol>
<br> <br>
<p class="whatcanschools">In schools specifically, where there are typically COVID response task forces in place to focus on health and safety, here are suggestions for ways to incorporate and acknowledge how physical barriers can affect any of those with learning differences:
</p> <br> <br>
<ol>
    <li class="help">Acknowledge the changes and potential challenges in task force updates.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Offer more on student counseling and encourage those who are not sure whether or not they have a learning difference to get tested.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Teachers should record each class, so that a student can rewind and rewatch if they miss information.
    </li>
    <li class="help">Teachers can update their syllabus and statements to include understanding language for those whom are affected by this. </li>
</ol>
